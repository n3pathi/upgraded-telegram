# Problem Statement 1: Multi-Modal Commuter Mobility in Cities

Context: Poor and fragmented mobility has been considered a key contributor to restrained economic growth, deteriorated quality of life, increased usage of private vehicles, congestion in cities, increased cost of transportation, increase of road accidents, etc. Various cities in India still have fragmented transportation systems which impacts lives of millions of commuters. We need to address this problem and provide a more seamless and integrated experience to the commuter and enable various stakeholders in the mobility ecosystem with a mechanism to effectively integrate with each other. An Integrated Multi-modal Commuter Transport System will combine the strengths of different transport systems and will allow the commuters to have a seamless experience throughout their journey. The system will also try to address typical concerns regarding multi-modal transportation systems, including the coordination between multiple modes of travel, integration and settlement procedures, degree of certainty to reach a destination in defined time, level of comfort, etc.

# Problem Statement 2: Multi-Modal Freight Handling and Transportation

Context: The Turn-Around Time (TAT) for major ports in India has progressively decreased from 117 hours in 2011-12 to 64 hours in 2017-18. However the Singapore port has a TAT that is less than 24 hours, which is where we aspire to be. Under the 'Sagarmala Programme' of Government of India, Rs. 8.5 trillion investment is envisaged for enhancement of port connectivity via road, rail, multi-modal logistics parks, pipelines & waterways and promote coastal community development, which would result in boosting merchandise exports by US $110 billion, and generation of around 10,000,000 direct and indirect jobs. These logistics bottlenecks cause substantial economic loss impacting manufacturers, traders and consumers.

# Problem Statement 3: Future of Mobility

Context: One of the key hurdles towards mass adoption of EV in India is consumer confidence and sentiment towards it. It stems from the fear among EV users of the precious time lost while re-charging EV batteries or running out of fuel before reaching their destination. In most path-breaking technologies and solutions, infrastructure always precedes innovation. The usage and penetration of internet, 4G telecom towers enabled data proliferation in India. Similar is the case for EVs for which a robust infrastructure is needed for its mass adoption. It is imperative to provide choices to the consumers in terms of charging or battery swapping, which will drive the future.

# Problem Statement 4: Road Safety

Context: Road safety is of paramount importance for the Government and the entire mobility ecosystem. While the number of road accidents has reduced over the last couple of years, still the overall number of accidents that occurred in 2017 is alarming. It has been assessed that 90% of the accident fatalities occur due to human error. “Brasilia Declaration on Road Safety” envisages to halve road traffic deaths by the end of this decade. There are number of interventions being adopted to reduce the occurrence of the road accidents. A technological solution/platform which can rate driver behavior and predict accident hot spot is the need of the hour. This will enable enforcement agencies and the commuters to take preemptive actions to avoid accidents.

# Problem Statement 5: Artificial Intelligence for Indian Transport Infrastructure

Context: New age developments in transportation such as autonomous and assisted driving solutions are based on fundamental underlying models for object detection in vehicular traffic conditions. India’s sheer diversity in traffic behavior and conditions presents a frontier challenge for all such assisted and autonomous driving solutions. The existing machine learning algorithms need to be made robust to enable them to operate in the Indian traffic conditions. In addition, the road transport infrastructure needs to be constantly monitored for its quality and upkeep. Given India’s large road network, low cost and efficient modes of infrastructure monitoring need to be developed. Satellite images of roads and neighboring infrastructure can serve as an economical way to map and assess road infrastructure along the 5.5 million km long network.

# Problem Statement 6: Drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in India

Context: The benefits of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are well known. Drones also bring in a range of issues related security, privacy of the citizens, safety etc. Other major outstanding concerns are

Detection of drones and UAVs: It is not trivial to identify flying objects accurately and also remove false alarms.
Unlawful trespassing by drones: Geo-fencing is great concept to demarcate the areas where drones are allowed along with their permissions. There is a need for a central national database for the list of geofenced areas and specific identified drones that can/cannot fly in those areas. Once a drone is detected, how can it be verified whether this is an allowed drone or one that has entered un-lawfully? Unlawful drone detection has to inform the drone operator, the traffic controller in real-time or based on the security level can be automatically destroyed. Technology to enable the above activities to be proposed as part of the solution.
Drone traffic management system: Once drones become more popular over the years, there would be several drones in the sky for various reasons - delivering goods, security surveillance, monitoring, etc. A traffic management system is required to ensure there is no mid-air collision of these objects and how can they be managed by a central city authority? This traffic management system would have a central dashboard which would combine the above issues of drone detection, information of geo-fencing, unlawful trespassing, route monitoring and sending real-time response based on alerts.
